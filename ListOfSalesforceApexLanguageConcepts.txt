Below are the key concepts in Salesforce Apex:
 
1. Classes: The backbone of Apex, classes organize code into logical, reusable pieces. 
They define the structure and behavior of objects.
 
2. Triggers: These are pieces of code that execute before or after specific data manipulation events, 
such as insertions, updates, or deletions.
 
3. SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language): Similar to SQL, SOQL is used to query data from Salesforce 
objects.
 
4. SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language): Used to perform text searches within Salesforce records.
 
5. DML (Data Manipulation Language): Includes operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and UPSERT to 
manipulate data in Salesforce.
 
6. Governor Limits: Salesforce imposes limits to ensure efficient use of resources in a multi-tenant 
environment. These include limits on CPU time, heap size, and the number of DML statements.
 
7. Asynchronous Apex: Includes features like Future Methods, Batch Apex, Queueable Apex, and 
Scheduled Apex for handling long-running operations.
 
8. Exception Handling: Mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions using try, catch, finally, and 
custom exceptions.
 
9. Test Classes: Apex provides built-in support for unit testing, allowing developers to write test 
methods to ensure code quality and coverage.
 
10. Apex Triggers: Code that runs automatically in response to specific events on a particular object, 
such as before or after records are inserted or updated.
 
11. Apex Methods: Functions defined within a class to perform specific actions.
 
12. Apex Properties: Variables within a class that can be accessed like fields but have getter and 
setter methods.
 
13. Apex Interfaces: Define methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
 
14. Apex Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit methods and properties from another class.
 
These concepts form the foundation of Apex programming and are essential for developing robust applications on the Salesforce platform123.
